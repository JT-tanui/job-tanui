A simple web app that allows users to calculate their body mass index (BMI) based on their weight and height:

This web app consists of an HTML file that contains a form with two input fields for weight and height, a button to calculate BMI, and a paragraph to display the result. The JavaScript code uses the values entered in the form to calculate the BMI and displays the result on the page. This is a simple example, but it demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to perform calculations and interact with the user interface.
